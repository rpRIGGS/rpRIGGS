ðŸ‘‹ I'm @rpRIGGS, owner of **PowerMoves Gaming** and the driving force behind **PowerMoves Development**.

ðŸŽ® My passion lies in crafting immersive roleplay experiences on FiveM, with **PowerMoves RP** as our flagship project. We're also expanding into new territories with PowerMoves RP on RedM and PowerMoves DayZ in the planning phase.

ðŸ’» As a lead developer, my core expertise is in **Lua scripting**. While my primary preference is the **qb-core framework**, I actively develop with robust support for **qbx_core** and **ESX**, ensuring broad compatibility for our scripts.

ðŸ’¡ With over **5 years of personal roleplay experience** across major servers, I bring a unique "roleplayer's perspective" to development. This allows me to tackle the common "I wish the script could do this..." challenges, creating innovative solutions that foster deeper, more immersive roleplay scenarios.

ðŸš€ I'm constantly innovating, optimizing, and pushing the boundaries to deliver high-performance and truly engaging gameplay across all our ventures.

ðŸ’¬ Let's connect if you're interested in game development, server architecture, or collaborating on next-level roleplay mechanics. Find me on Discord: `#rpRIGGS`
