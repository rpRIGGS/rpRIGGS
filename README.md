ðŸ‘‹ I'm @rpRIGGS, the driving force behind **PowerMoves Gaming** and **PowerMoves Development**.

ðŸŽ® As the owner, I lead the creation and management of diverse roleplay experiences. Our flagship project, **PowerMoves RP on FiveM**, is currently in active server development. We're also expanding, with **PowerMoves RP on RedM** and **PowerMoves DayZ** both in the planning phase.

ðŸ’» My hands-on role extends to **PowerMoves Development**, our dedicated FiveM script division. With over **5 years of personal roleplay experience** across major servers, I bring a unique "roleplayer's perspective" to every script. This insight allows me to tackle a long list of "I wish the script could do this..." problems, developing solutions that foster broader, more immersive roleplay scenarios. My specialization is in crafting robust **Lua** solutions, primarily leveraging the **qb-core framework**, while also tackling broader FiveM development challenges.

ðŸ’¡ I'm constantly innovating and optimizing across all our ventures, aiming to deliver unique, high-performance, and truly immersive gameplay.
